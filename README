This was a project I created for my ICS 62 Game Technologies class to expand upon the Unity Roll-A-Ball tutorial.  I used the basic movement methods of the original tutorial and the assets that my teamates and I created in order to design my game around a floating mechanic.  Using this mechanic, the player can float slightly off the ground in order to move across chasms, but they cannot fly up into the air.  Thus the whole puzzle mechanic revolves around the player floating to a platform of equal height to then travel on the ground to a higher platform to get to a new area.  This is only a prototype created in one week in order to show the mechanics and art assests.
